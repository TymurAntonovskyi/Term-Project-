# Term Project 
[Link for original dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/manjeetsingh/retaildataset)

### Content

You are provided with historical sales data for 45 stores located in different regions - each store contains a number of departments. The company also runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of which are the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The weeks including these holidays are weighted five times higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks.
Within the Excel Sheet, there are 3 Tabs â€“ Stores, Features and Sales

#### Stores

Anonymized information about the 45 stores, indicating the type and size of store

#### Features
Contains additional data related to the store, department, and regional activity for the given dates.

 - Store - the store number
 - Date - the week
 - Temperature - average temperature in the region
 - Fuel_Price - cost of fuel in the region
 - MarkDown1-5 - anonymized data related to promotional markdowns. MarkDown data is only available after Nov 2011, and is not available for all stores all the time. Any missing value is marked with an NA
 - CPI - the consumer price index
 - Unemployment - the unemployment rate
 - IsHoliday - whether the week is a special holiday week
#### Sales
Historical sales data, which covers to 2010-02-05 to 2012-11-01. Within this tab you will find the following fields:

 - Store - the store number
 - Dept - the department number
 - Date - the week
 - Weekly_Sales -  sales for the given department in the given store
 - IsHoliday - whether the week is a special holiday week
 
 
 ### Aim of the analysis 
 The aim of this work is to analyze the reltionship betwwen the TotalValue of MarkDowns in 5 different shops and The total amont of sales. Along with it, aim is to check how other variables may influance the Weekly_Sales in each shop.

USE project;  
```

### Table Creation 
Operational data layer 

#### Features table
```sql
USE project; 
CREATE TABLE features 
( ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
Store INTEGER NOT NULL,
Date_N DATE NOT NULL,
Temperature DECIMAL(4,2) NOT NULL,
Fuel_Price DECIMAL(3,2) NOT NULL,
MarkDown1 INTEGER NOT NULL,

CPI DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL ,
Unemployment DECIMAL(2,1) NOT NULL ,
IsHoliday INTEGER);  
```
Use the following link for accessing data for features table
[Features.csv](https://github.com/TymurAntonovskyi/Term-Project-/blob/main/Featuresdata.csv)

##### Load data to Features table
```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE 'c:/Program Files/MySQL/Uploads/Featuresdata.csv'  
INTO TABLE features 
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n' 
IGNORE 1 LINES ;  
```


#### Sales Table
```sql
USE project; 
CREATE TABLE Sales
(ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
Store INTEGER NOT NULL,
Date_N DATE NOT NULL,
Weekly_Sales INTEGER NOT NULL,
IsHoliday INTEGER); 
```
Use the following link for accessing data for sales table
[Sales.csv](https://github.com/TymurAntonovskyi/Term-Project-/blob/main/Salesdata.csv)

##### Load data to Sales table
```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE 'c:/Program Files/MySQL/Uploads/Salesdata.csv'  
INTO TABLE sales 
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n' 
IGNORE 1 LINES ;
```

#### Stores table
```sql
USE project; 
CREATE TABLE Stores
(Store INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
Type_N VARCHAR(16) NOT NULL,
Size INTEGER NOT NULL); 
```
Use the following link for accessing data for stores table
[Stores.csv](https://github.com/TymurAntonovskyi/Term-Project-/blob/main/Storesdata.csv)

##### Load data to Stores table
```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE 'c:/Program Files/MySQL/Uploads/Storesdata.csv'  
INTO TABLE Stores 
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n' 
IGNORE 1 LINES ;
```

### Data adjustment
On Features table we have 5 different types of MarkDowns and their final value in each week. Unfortunately, there is no information about these markdowns so for a particular project there is no sense to store them independently. As a result, a new column(Total_MarkDown) was added.

```sql
ALTER TABLE features 
ADD Total_MarkDown INT AS ( MarkDown1 + MarkDown2 + MarkDown3 + MarkDown4 + MarkDown5) STORED;
```

### Data pre-testing
The aim of this section is to analyse the distribution of values in dataset and identify trends.

Aim: To identify the Consumer Price Index in each region
```sql
Select Store,avg(CPI) as AVG_CPI from features 
GROUP BY Store
ORDER BY avg(CPI) desc ; 
```
Aim: To identify the average level of Unemployment in each region
```sql
Select Store,avg(Unemployment) as AVG_Unemployment_Rate,
CASE 
WHEN avg(Unemployment) > 6.93217 THEN "Above Average"
WHEN avg(Unemployment) < 6.93217 THEN "Below Average"
END as Unemployment_lvl
 from features 
GROUP BY Store
ORDER BY avg(Unemployment) desc ; 
```
Aim: To check if Fuel Price is different in different Regions --
```sql
Select Store, avg(Fuel_Price) as AVG_FuelPrice from features 
GROUP BY Store
ORDER BY avg(Fuel_Price) desc ; 
```
To see sales tendency from 2010 until 2012 in each of the shops
```sql
sum( case when year(s.Date_N) = 2010 then Weekly_Sales end) as "2010",
sum( case when year(s.Date_N) = 2011 then Weekly_Sales end) as "2011",
sum( case when year(s.Date_N) = 2012 then Weekly_Sales end) as "2012"
from sales as s
group by store
order by Weekly_Sales desc;
```

As a result of pretesting,the following statements can be highlighted:
1. The price of Fuel in all regions is approximately the same.
2. The Unemployment rate is the biggest in the 2 regions(2nd Shop) and the Consumer Price Index is above average.
3. The introduction of discount policy in shops had ambiguous effect on sales. 



## Analytical layer 
For the following analysis variable, like: ID, Weekly_Sales, Total_MarkDown, Store, Data_N, CPI, Is_Holiday and Type_N were joined together for the following analysis.
The factor is Weekly Sales, while Total_MarkDown and CPI related to dimension 1, Data_N and Is_Holiday relate to dimension 2, Type_N is dimension 3.
The following table will be used for the further analysis of data.
```sql
select f.ID,s.Weekly_Sales,f.Total_MarkDown,f.Store,f.Date_N,f.CPI,f.IsHoliday,st.Type_N,
CASE
WHEN st.Type_N = "A" THEN "Big"
WHEN st.Type_N = "B" THEN "Small"
END AS Shop_Size 
from features as f
INNER join sales as s
USING(ID)
INNER JOIN stores as st
Where s.Store = st.Store
```
 Aim: To find exact dates and shops where were the biggerst Total MarkDown values
```sql
Select k.Store,k.Date_N,k.Total_MarkDown from
(select f.ID,s.Weekly_Sales,f.Total_MarkDown,f.Store,f.Date_N,f.CPI,f.IsHoliday,st.Type_N,
CASE
WHEN st.Type_N = "A" THEN "Big"
WHEN st.Type_N = "B" THEN "Small"
END AS Shop_Size 
from features as f
INNER join sales as s
USING(ID)
INNER JOIN stores as st
Where s.Store = st.Store) as k
ORDER BY Total_MarkDown desc
LIMIT 10;
```
As we can observe: Shops 2 and 4 provided the biggest amount of discounts during the period.
The biggest MarkDowns among shops were available in February during the SuperBowl championship and during Christmas holidays.


Aim: To see the sales CPI before and after the introduction of Discount policies in each shop.
```sql
Select YEAR(Date_N) as Year, sum(Total_MarkDown) as Total_MarkDown , sum(Weekly_Sales) as Yearly_Sales ,avg(k.CPI) as AVG_CPI
FROM 
(select f.ID,s.Weekly_Sales,f.Total_MarkDown,f.Store,f.Date_N,f.CPI,f.Unemployment,f.IsHoliday,st.Type_N,
CASE
WHEN st.Type_N = "A" THEN "Big"
WHEN st.Type_N = "B" THEN "Small"
END AS Shop_Size 
from features as f
INNER join sales as s
USING(ID)
INNER JOIN stores as st
Where s.Store = st.Store) as k
Group by YEAR(Date_N);
```
As we can see the sales in total the sales increased at the end of 2011 when MarkDowns policies were implemented.



Aim: To see sales per each year considering the equal amount of months in each year. In particular dataset the historical data about discount policy available until October of 2012. 

```sql
Select YEAR(Date_N) as Year, sum(Total_MarkDown) as Total_MarkDown , sum(Weekly_Sales) as Weekly_Sales ,avg(k.CPI) as AVG_CPI, avg(k.Unemployment) as AVG_Unemployment
FROM 
(select f.ID,s.Weekly_Sales,f.Total_MarkDown,f.Store,f.Date_N,f.CPI,f.Unemployment,f.IsHoliday,st.Type_N,
CASE
WHEN st.Type_N = "A" THEN "Big"
WHEN st.Type_N = "B" THEN "Small"
END AS Shop_Size 
from features as f
INNER join sales as s
USING(ID)
INNER JOIN stores as st
Where s.Store = st.Store) as k
where Month(k.Date_N) in (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
Group by YEAR(Date_N);
```



Aim: to check the total amount of Weekly_Sales and MarkDown(where applicable) in each year and month
```sql
Select YEAR(Date_N),Month(Date_N), k.Store, sum(Total_MarkDown), sum(Weekly_Sales)
FROM 
(select f.ID,s.Weekly_Sales,f.Total_MarkDown,f.Store,f.Date_N,f.CPI,f.IsHoliday,st.Type_N,
CASE
WHEN st.Type_N = "A" THEN "Big"
WHEN st.Type_N = "B" THEN "Small"
END AS Shop_Size 
from features as f
INNER join sales as s
USING(ID)
INNER JOIN stores as st
Where s.Store = st.Store) as k
Group by YEAR(Date_N),Month(Date_N),k.Store;
```


Aim: Compare Total Sales in Februaty(Month of SuperBowl championship) month before and after introduction the discounts
```sql
select p.Weekly_Sales, p.Total_MarkDown from (
select  s.ID, s.Weekly_Sales,f.Total_MarkDown
from features as f
INNER join sales as s
USING(ID)
WHERE YEAR(f.Date_N) in ("2010") 
AND Month(f.Date_N) in (2)) as p
WHERE p.Total_MarkDown = 0 
union all
Select p.Weekly_Sales, p.Total_MarkDown from (
select s.ID, s.Weekly_Sales,f.Total_MarkDown
from features as f
INNER join sales as s
USING(ID)
WHERE YEAR(f.Date_N) in ("2012") 
AND Month(f.Date_N) in (2)) as p
WHERE p.Total_MarkDown <> 0;
```
